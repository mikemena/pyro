1. Model Architecture & Training

[] In train_model_v2 --> make sure I have SMOTE - weight class at network level?

[] Add train_model_v3 --> previous models are quite basic - just a simple feedforward network with ReLU and dropout. v3 adds the following:

- Batch normalization to stabilize training
- Learning rate scheduling (learning rate stays constant)
- Limited regularization techniques
